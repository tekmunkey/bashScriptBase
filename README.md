# bashScriptBase

The documentation on this product is best viewed inside the scripts themselves.  Order of includes is:

0x00:  scriptDirectory (contains directory resolutions)

0x01:  scriptCLI (Command Line Interpreter)

0x02:  scriptHelp (help system)

So the only script you actually need to include is scriptHelp.

At some point I may have time to go in and document each function from each file individually, but unfortunately that time has not been up to (and still is not) now.
